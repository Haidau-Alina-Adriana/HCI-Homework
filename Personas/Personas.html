        <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                Maria has been working in the banking business for more than 8 years. After her father died when she was young from a car accident, she was raised by her mother. In her free time she volunteers and likes to get involved in social cases. She enjoys listening
                to the radio, watching sports and dancing. She is very empathetic and loves bringing a smile on people's faces. In the last year she began to have a passion for nature and plants. In the future, she wants to have as many plants as possible
                to take care of. She buys new plants every week, so sometimes is hard for her to remember for each individual plant when it was the last time she watered / added fertilizer, and needs an app that can do that for her. Also, having no advanced
                studies in biology, she wants an application that will make her work easier and helps her find all the information about her plants in one place. Because she doesn't have biology studies, she would love to learn more about plants and she
                is thinking about getting a degree in biology.

                </li>
                <li>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Scenario 2: Maria has more than 50 plants and can't remember the last time she watered a specific plant. She can't remember if it was 2 weeks ago or 2 month ago. She can check the last time she watered the plant by entering the app and look for her in
                My plants section. If the plant needs constant watering and Maria didn't mark as watered, the plant will appear in Home page because she needs "attention".
