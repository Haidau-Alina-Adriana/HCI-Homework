        <h2><span>1. </span>The scope of application</h2>
        <p>
            I created a graphical interface for an application that helps people to take care of their plants.

        <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There are more and more people in the world who are passionate about nature and with plants in general. Not all plants need to be watered as often as others, and also not all plants need to be fertilized as often (if you want your plants to live as much
            as possible). With this app a person can keep track of their interaction with their little buddies.
            <br><span class="tab"></span>In the same time this app comes in handy for those people that want to find the right informations fast and with no further research, because it can be difficult to find the right data when there is a lot of contradictory
            and overwhelming informations on the internet.

        <h2><span>3. </span>Application architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The mobile application opens with the start page, which after taping a user can log in or create a new account if he doesn't have one. After authentication/registration, he is redirected to the main page where there are two possible outcomes: either the
            page has only a discover section and instagram community section, either a list of plants that need to be taken care of. From here, the user can update watering/adding fertilizer informations or can use the bottom menu to go to the plants
            he saved, to the plants that he currently has, to his profile or to the searching feature.
            <br><span class="tab"></span>The application contains 10 pages.

                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Morphing Controls - Present in Find plant page when the user can simply tap hart and the plant is added to the favorites list. The user knows that if the heart is red then is in favorites list and if it's not red. then is not in favorites list.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Prospective memory - This design pattern is present in Favorites page where the user can save a plant or more for another time.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            Content Structuring - In My plants page each plant has her section. This helps the user to navigate to a certain plant quickly by taping on the plant.
                        </li>
                        <br>
